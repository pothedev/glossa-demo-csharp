# üéôÔ∏è Glossa

**Glossa** is a C#-based real-time interpreter app that combines **speech recognition**, **machine translation**, and **text-to-speech synthesis** using state-of-the-art APIs. It routes audio through **Voicemeeter Potato** to enable seamless input/output manipulation.

## üöÄ Features

### üéß Input (STT)
- **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text** ‚Äì Streams microphone input and transcribes speech in real time.

### üåç Translation
- **DeepL API** ‚Äì Translates recognized speech into your target language with high linguistic quality.

### üîä Output (TTS)
Supports multiple TTS engines:
- **ElevenLabs Multilingual v2** ‚Äì Natural-sounding multilingual voice synthesis.
- **Google Cloud WaveNet** ‚Äì High-fidelity text-to-speech with neural voices.
- **Windows Native Synthesizer** ‚Äì Offline fallback using built-in .NET `System.Speech.Synthesis`.

All three TTS engines offer different trade-offs: **ElevenLabs** provides the highest voice quality but is relatively slower; **Google WaveNet** balances speed and quality well; and the **Native Synthesizer** is the fastest but with noticeably lower voice quality.

## üß† Modes of Operation

At startup, you can choose between:
- `1` ‚Äî **Input only** (STT & translation)
- `2` ‚Äî **Output only** (TTS from queued text)
- `3` ‚Äî **Both** (Live interpretation mode)

## üéß Audio Routing Diagrams

Glossa uses **Voicemeeter Potato** to manage all audio streams. Below are detailed diagrams of how input and output audio are routed through the system.

### üó£Ô∏è Input Audio Flow

This diagram shows how user speech is captured, translated, and sent back into a voice chat app:

![Input Audio Flow](./assets/input_audio_flow.jpg)

> The original speech is captured by a physical microphone and routed into **Glossa** for STT + translation + TTS. The translated speech is sent into **Voicemeeter AUX**, then forwarded to **Voicemeeter VAIO**, which is set as the mic for your voice chat app via **B1**.

---

### üîä Output Audio Flow

This diagram shows how both original speech and translated output are routed to your speakers:

![Output Audio Flow](./docs/output_audio_flow.jpg)

> The voice chat app‚Äôs original output is routed to **Voicemeeter VAIO**, while translated TTS from Glossa goes to **Voicemeeter AUX**. Both streams are merged and sent to your **physical output device** via **A1**.

---

> üí° You can customize which Voicemeeter strips Glossa uses in the config ‚Äî this enables flexible setups like silent TTS, split outputs, or interpretation-only modes.
